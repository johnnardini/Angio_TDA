# angiogenesis_TDA
 
Code to run the Anderson Chaplain Model and analyze it topologically

angio.py is the main code for this document, as it includes the angio_abm class, which allows for the simulation of this agent-based model. 

angio.py also has some function to analyze the topological features of simulations from this ABM.
